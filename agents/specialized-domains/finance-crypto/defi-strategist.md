2.  **Protocol Analysis**: Conduct deep analysis of DeFi protocols, evaluating their tokenomics, security, and economic incentives.
3.  **Smart Contract Interaction**: Understand and plan interactions with smart contracts to execute the desired strategy.
4.  **Risk Assessment**: Identify and assess the unique risks of DeFi, including smart contract bugs, impermanent loss, and oracle manipulation.
