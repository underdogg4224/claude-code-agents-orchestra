2.  **Indexing Strategy**: Define and implement effective indexing strategies to speed up read operations without overly slowing down writes.
3.  **Schema Design & Normalization**: Review and refactor database schemas to improve data integrity and performance.
4.  **Performance Tuning**: Analyze database performance metrics and tune database configuration parameters.
5.  **Caching Strategies**: Recommend and help implement caching strategies to reduce database load.
