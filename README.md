## 🤔 Two Ways to Use This Agent Team: Direct Calls vs. Orchestration Framework

You can use this agent collection in two ways. Choose the approach that best fits your task.

| Aspect               | **Direct Agent Calls**                                                                                 | **Orchestration Framework Usage**                                                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **When to Use**      | For simple, focused, single-step tasks. (e.g., refactoring a function, reviewing a file for security). | For complex, multi-step missions requiring collaboration between multiple agents. (e.g., building a new feature, migrating a system). |
| **Who Orchestrates** | **You** are the orchestrator. You manually select and call the appropriate agent.                      | **Claude** becomes the orchestrator, guided by the rules in `CLAUDE.md.example`. It automatically plans and delegates tasks.          |
| **Pros**             | No setup required. Fast and direct for simple jobs.                                                    | Automates complex planning and coordination, significantly reducing your workload.                                                    |
| **Cons**             | You are responsible for managing all steps and context for complex tasks.                              | Requires a one-time setup of copying `CLAUDE.md.example` to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.                                                    |

## 👑 Orchestration Example: Using `CLAUDE.md.example`

> **⚠️ Important:** The following sections and the `CLAUDE.md.example` file demonstrate **one possible way** to orchestrate this team of specialist agents. This is a powerful but optional framework. You are encouraged to adapt it, build your own, or integrate these agents into your existing workflow.

The provided framework turns Claude into a project manager that can automatically triage tasks, delegate to the correct specialists, and manage complex workflows, all while waiting for your approval.

### How to Apply the Example Framework

```bash
# First, backup your existing global rules, if any
cp ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.backup

# Apply the orchestration framework
cp CLAUDE.md.example ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md
```

Now, Claude will use the rules in the example file to manage the agent team in this project.

### Example in Action

With the framework active, interactions look like this:

**Simple Task:**

```
You: "Fix the login bug"

Claude: "📋 EXECUTION PLAN
         ════════════════
         Classification: Simple
         Assigned to: @debugger
         Plan: Analyze login flow, identify bug, implement fix
         ⚠️ AWAITING APPROVAL"

You: "approved"
Claude: "🔄 @debugger investigating login issue..."
```

**Complex Mission:**

```
You: "Build a real-time chat system"

Claude: "📋 EXECUTION PLAN
         ════════════════
         Classification: Complex Mission
         Assigned to: @tech-lead-orchestrator
         ...
         Agent List:
         @api-architect, @backend-architect, @react-expert, @security-auditor
         ⚠️ AWAITING APPROVAL"

You: "proceed"
Claude: "Executing approved blueprint... 🔄 Step 1/4..."
```

### Framework Details & Real-World Examples

<details>
<summary>Click to expand for detailed framework logic and examples</summary>

The framework is designed around a clear command structure and execution flow to ensure efficient and safe operation.

#### 🎯 Model Optimization Strategy

The framework intelligently assigns models based on cognitive demands:

- **Opus Model (Strategic Roles):** Used for complex system design, multi-agent coordination, security analysis, and architectural planning. (13 agents)
- **Sonnet Model (Implementation Roles):** Used for feature development, framework-specific code, tool integration, and content creation. (34 agents)

This optimization delivers **faster execution** for implementation tasks while maintaining **deep analytical capability** for strategic decisions.

#### 🔄 How It Works: The Enhanced Execution Framework

**Phase 1: Intelligent Triage & Authorization**
When you submit a request, Claude (acting as gatekeeper):

1.  **Classifies complexity** - Simple task (1-2 files) or complex mission (3+ files).
2.  **Delegates to specialists** - Routes to the appropriate agent or the `tech-lead-orchestrator`.
3.  **Presents execution plan** - Shows you exactly what will happen.
4.  **Waits for approval** - No execution without your explicit "approved" or "proceed".

**Phase 2: Coordinated Execution with Progress Tracking**

- **Critical Protocol:** All agent communication goes through the Task tool, the Tech Lead only creates blueprints (never executes), and Claude manages all execution after your approval.

**Phase 3: Enhanced Quality Assurance**

- Built-in quality gates include model-optimized reviews, parallel execution for independent tasks, and automatic error recovery.

**Phase 4: Smart Agent Authority**

- A clear command structure ensures specialists stay in their lane and the `tech-lead-orchestrator` focuses only on planning.

#### 🎬 Real-World Examples

**Example 1: E-Commerce Payment System**

- **You:** "Add Stripe checkout to my online store with subscription support"
- **Result:** A secure, PCI-compliant payment system with subscription management, built by a coordinated team of `Code Archaeologist`, `API Architect`, `Security Auditor`, `Payment Integration` expert, `Backend Architect`, `Django Expert`, `React Expert`, and `Test Automator`.

**Example 2: Mobile App Performance Crisis**

- **You:** "Our React Native app is freezing on the product list screen"
- **Result:** App performance improved by 400% after `Debugger`, `Mobile Developer`, `Performance Engineer`, `React Expert`, and `Database Optimizer` diagnose and fix an infinite re-render loop and N+1 query problem.

**Example 3: Legacy System Modernization**

- **You:** "Migrate our 10-year-old PHP monolith to microservices"
- **Result:** A successful migration to 12 microservices with 99.9% uptime, orchestrated by the `Tech Lead` and executed by `Legacy Modernizer`, `Code Archaeologist`, `Cloud Architect`, `Backend Architect`, `API Architect`, `DevOps Engineer`, `Laravel Expert`, `Database Optimizer`, `Test Automator`, and `Security Auditor`.

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Agents aren't coordinating or the tech-lead is trying to execute code directly.
**Solution**: Ensure you have applied the orchestration framework from `CLAUDE.md.example` to your global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` file.

**Problem**: Conflicts with existing `CLAUDE.md` instructions.
**Solution**: Carefully merge the key "ORCHESTRATION", "PROTOCOL", and "EXECUTION" sections from our example into your existing rules.
